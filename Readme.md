<h1>Elder Scrolls Online Bible Reader</h1>

<p>This addon will print a bible verse every time you open a book in ESO to read.
It first chooses a book randomly when the game is first launched or when reloadui is called. Then it goes from the first chapter, first verse and prints all the way to the end of that book. So by the end of a long game period you can possibly read a whole book of the bible.</p>

<p>To install simply put the ESOBible folder into you addons folder and it will work</p>
